### Table of Contents:
- **Lab 1: Seven-Segment Decoder**
  - Built a single-digit (4-bit) hex counter to display its value on both four-digit common anode seven-segment LED
							displays
- **Lab 2: Four-Digit Hex Counter**
  - Built a four-digit (16-bit) counter to display its value on 7-segment displays
- **Lab 3: Bouncing Ball**
  - Programmed the FPGA to display a "bouncing ball" on a 800x600 Video Graphics Array (VGA) monitor
- **Lab 4: Hex Calculator**
  - Programmed the FPGA on the Nexys A7-100T board to function as a simple hexadecimal calculator capable of adding
							and subtracting four-digit hexadecimal numbers using a 16-button keypad module (Pmod KYPD) connected to the Pmod
							port JA
- **Lab 5: DAC Siren**
  - Programmed the FPGA on the Nexys A7-100T board to generate a wailing audio siren using a digital-to-analog (DAC) converter called Pmod Inter-IC Sound (I2S) with a speaker or headphone (WARNING: the siren is loud) connected to the top pins of the Pmod port JA
- **Lab 6: Video Game PONG**
  - Extended the FPGA code developed in Lab 3 (Bouncing Ball) to build a PONG game using a 800x600 Video Graphics
							Array (VGA) display and a 5kÎ© potentiometer with an analog-to-digital converter called Pmod ADC connected to the
							top pins of the Pmod port JA
